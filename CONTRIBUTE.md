## Getting Started

To contribute, you will need:

- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your local machine
- A fork of this repository
- A properly configured local development environment (see project README for setup instructions)

---

## Workflow

We follow the **GitFlow Workflow** for managing development.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch from `main` for your changes.
3. Make your changes in that branch.
4. Push the branch to your fork.
5. Open a **Pull Request** (PR) against the `main` branch in this repository.

All contributions must be submitted via pull request â€” **no direct pushes to `main` are allowed**.

---

## Branch Naming Convention

Branches for new features must follow this pattern:

```
feature/conluzweb-XXX
```

- `XXX` refers to the issue or ticket number (e.g., `feature/conluz-123`).

---

## Commit Message Format

All commits must follow this format:

```
[conluzweb-XXX] Your commit message
```

**Examples:**

- `[conluzweb-101] Add login page`
- `[conluzweb-205] Fix energy consumption bug`

> This format helps maintain traceability between commits and issues.

---

## Pull Requests

- Pull requests must target the `main` branch.
- Use **Squash and Merge** as the merge strategy.
- Ensure your PR references the related issue (e.g., "Closes #123").
- Provide a clear description of the changes made.
- Ensure all CI checks pass and the code is properly tested.

---

## Coding

- The code must follow Clean Code standards.
- The code must be self explanatory adding comments when further explanation is required.
- The code must be in English.
- The code must be tested through automated tests to validate it works as expected.
